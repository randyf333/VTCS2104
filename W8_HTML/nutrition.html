        <p>My favorite dish: Scallion pancakes</p>
        <p>Scallion pancakes are a popular dish throughout China. It is a type of flatbread that is pan fried in oil to give it 
            a crispy outside and chewy interior. Its a savory dish with a slight scallion taste that is made from dough instead of 
            batter like other types of bread. Scallions are then mixed into the dough before the dough is cooked. 
            It ends up having multiple layers to give the pancake its chewy texture. Nutritionally, the dish acts similar to other 
            types of bread, acting as a carbohydrate in a meal or as a snack.
