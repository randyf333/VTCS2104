# VTCS2104
All coding projects done in CS2104 (Intro to Problem Solving in Computer Science)


*From the VT CS Department*

This course introduces the student to a broad range of heuristics for solving problems in a range of settings. Emphasis on problem-solving techniques that aid programmers and computer scientists. Heuristics for solving problems ''in the small'' (classical math and word problems), generating potential solutions to ''real-life'' problems encountered in the profession, and problem solving in teams.

Having successfully completed this course, the student will be able to:

Identify skills and personality traits of successful problem solving.
Apply standard problem-solving heuristics to aid in problem solving.
Apply problem-solving techniques to programming activities.
Apply problem-solving techniques to school and personal interactions.
Apply pairs and team problem-solving techniques.
Generate potential solutions to problems with standard heuristics.
Formulate and successfully communicate the solutions to problems.
