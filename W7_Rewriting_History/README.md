# Homework 7 - Rewriting History with Git
## Merging and Branching

The purpose of this assignment is to practice merging and branching with Git. You are given a master branch with some popular Computer Science problems, but unfortunately the student did not pay attention in class and wrote very inefficient code.

This student also did not pay attention when learning git. They made a new branch with their more efficent solutions (because they read their textbook, finally...) but they diverged from master after the initial commit and need to put the pieces back together again. You will need to merge the two branches together to get the most efficient code but also preserve the test cases, which only exist on the master branch. You will also need to resolve merge conflicts along the way.

Do not push your changes, as you do not have the permissions to do so.

Good luck!
